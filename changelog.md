## Version 2.0

- Updated the get_var_lengths description to be more accurate.

- The linked list (micli->token->var_lst) used to store resolved variable addresses for every token was not being freed and set to null between tokens, causing a segmentation fault when variables were used in multiple arguments to a single command. This has been fixed.

- When a command line ended in a variable and a ';', the ';' was being flagged for deletion along with the variable name by micli_cpy, causing the next command not to be processed. This has been fixed.

- A distinction has been made between variables with validity for a given command+arguments, henceforth 'command line' or 'cmdline', which will now be stored in micli->cmdline, and variables with validity for a given token, henceforth 'token', which will continue to be stored in micli->token. This has been done to clarify when each type of data needs to be reset, as the program parses in strict hierarchical order (see *Basic Overview*).
