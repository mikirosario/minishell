** The function ft_strlen16 is used to measure the length of the short strong.
** Each character in the short string is then passed to the short_to_chars
** auxiliary function, which converts it into a character string of one or two
** chars, as needed to store the same value, called short_char.
**
** The join_to_string function is then called to concatenate short_char to the
** character string whose address will be returned to the user. This is
** reapeated until the entire short string is reassembled as a character string.
** If no prior character string exists yet, join_to_string will create a new
** character string with short_char as the stem.

** The completed character string is returned to the user. NOTE: Like normal dup
** functions, this function will not free the original string.
