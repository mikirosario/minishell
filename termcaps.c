** The following capabilities are mandatory by order of the King of Spain:
**
** - cur_up, we won't get very far without being able to move up, eh?
** - cur_left, can you imagine a terminal without being able to move left?
** - cur_right, moving left and right is pretty basic, yes?
** - carriage_ret, this feature dates back to the XIX century, no excuses!
** - del_line, this is more convenience for me, but I'm worth it!
** - arrow_up, this is the arrow up sequence in keypad mode, used for scroll
** - arrow_down, this is the arrow down sequence in keypad mode
**
** The strlen condition is a bit silly, but I originally programmed this to
** handle the standard vt100 ANSI codes and then adapted for termcaps, so,
** basically, the parser is not designed to handle arrow escape sequences that
** aren't exactly 3 charactesr long. xD I want to avoid rewriting the thing to
** be more flexible, and really I only need it to work with keypad mode vt100,
** which is also 3 characters, so I just ban sequences of any other length. If
** there ARE any novel 3-character sequences that aren't \eOA and \eOB, though,
** this minishell SHOULD work with them. ;)
**
** I use derive esc_seq to get the initial two-character short for the up and
** down arrows, and I check the third character in the saved sequences for the
** id. It is all really rather silly and it seems to me this stuff could just be
** hardcoded, BUT, it is OBLIGATORY to use termcaps with the arrow keys, so I am
** using termcaps with the arrow keys... :p

** First we use find_var to find the TERM environment variable. The find_var
** function is my version of getenv, but unlike getenv it returns a pointer to
** the key, rather than the value, so if the key is found we need to also skip
** it and make sure the value exists after the key. If either of these checks
** fail... that's a paddling.
**
** If a termtype is found at the TERM variable, we try to load its associated
** database into the term buffer with tgetent. If that fails it will return 0 if
** the database could not be found, or -1 if it was found but could not be
** accessed. For the former we record failure condition 0 and for the latter
** failure condition -1.
**
** If crucial capabilities are found lacking in the terminal we report failure
** condition -2.
**
** Finally we will try to get the terminal attributes with tcgetattr. If this
** fails we report failure condition -3.
**
** We send all the results to termcaps_init_fail. If any failure happened along
** the way, it will print the appropriate error message and abort the program.
