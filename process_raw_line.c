** zeroed, so I don't null terminate anything either. Use calloc.
**
** If DEL is found, the character is not copied. If SUB is found, the character
** is substituted for the next resolved variable in var_lst.
**
** If src is larger than dst your computer explodes.
**
** Not a friendly function. I wouldn't recommend copying it. ;)

** This function accepts the address of the start of a new command line and
** returns the address of the end of the same command line to the calling
** function.
**
** Everything in the while (is_cmdline) loop is part of a single, continuous
** command line, and so the loop will continue until it discovers the end of the
** command line, which may be ';', signifying new command, '|', signifying new
** piped command, or '\0', signifying '\n' or EOF.
**
** The pointer lindex is used to iterate through the line from lstart until a
** ';', '|' or '\0'' (meaning '\n' or EOF) is found, at which point the fragment
** from lstart until the ';', '|' or NULL is passed to the process_cmdline
** function for tokenization. If an escape flag is detected at the beginning of
** the loop, we advance the index to analyse the character after it and set the
** flag to 1 to indicate the fact.
**
** Characters that are escaped or quoted will not count as the end of a command
** line, except, of course, the '\0' as we don't do multiline commands.
**
** NOTE:
** Note that in this particular implementation of the escape flag it isn't
** necessary to do an escape flag check in is_escape_char, because it will
** always return 0, but the check was designed for compatibility with a prior,
** less efficient escape flag routine I wrote that does require this check. So
** don't touch it, you'll break everything. ;)

** This function parses a single line read from STDIN or a file to delineate
** the beginning and end of a command and all its arguments (undifferentiated).
**
** EOF or \n within the line has been translated to '\0' by this stage, so it is
** null-terminated.
**
** The pointer lstart is pointed to the beginning of the command + arguments.
** It starts by pointing to the beginning of the line. Spaces are skipped.
**
** If the last command line ended in ';' we might be at the start of a new
** pipeline. For example: "echo 2 | cat; echo 6 | cat | less". If pipes are then
** detected in the new command line, we are definitely at the start of a new
** pipeline. If that is the case, we do a pipe_reset to prepare the pipeline
** ahead of time with a bit of pre-processing.
**
** After a command line is processed, we advance one character and skip any
** subsequence spaces to retrieve the beginning of the next command line,
** assuming that we aren't going to be interested in the last character of the
** line (';' or '|'). Of course, we only do this if the character is not '\0'.
**
** The cmdline_end variable is a 'Ã±apa' to save the last preceding end of a
** command line so that we know whether we need to check for a new pipeline.
** Thus, since at the beginning of a raw line we always need to check, it starts
** initialized at ';'. Could do this with
** if (*lindex == ';' || lindex == &line[0]) too, but that's two checks instead
** of a char assignment and a check. :/ Don't judge me. :p
**
** Test functionality with this sequence:
** echo 2*2 | bc | cat; echo this \| "is |" 'a |' test; echo 2+3 | bc 
** Should return:
** 4
** this | is | a | test
** 5
** echo 2*5 > in; echo "="; bc<in>out; echo 2*10>in; echo "="; bc <in >>out;
** cat out
** Should return:
** =
** =
** 10
** 20
