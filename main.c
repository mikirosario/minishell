#include "minishell.h"

/*
** This function defines a buffer for reading from STDIN in steps determined by
** the READLINE_BUFSIZE constant.
**
** It will try to reserve memory for READLINE_BUFSIZE bytes. If it fails it
** will print the message pointed to by the result of strerror(errno) (should
** be no. 28 "No space left on device") and initiate program termination.
**
** When reading from STDIN the read() function hangs until '\n' newline or
** terminal EOF is input, after which it will read the first thing in its
** buffer in a chunk defined by the third argument and copy it to the address
** passed as the second argument. For every subsequent call it will read the
** subsequent chunk in the buffer until the newline or EOF. If the third
** argument defines a chunk size that is larger than what remains
** in the buffer to be read, the smaller size will be read. After reaching
** newline or EOF it will hang again pending another newline or EOF. Newline
** counts as a character.
**
** This function has been rewritten from the initial loop that more closely
** mirrored an online tutorial to better use the read buffer. The read function
** will now read up to READLINE_BUFSIZE bytes from stdout at a time and copy
** them to the buffer. The number of bytes read are returned and stored in the
** size variable.
**
** If READLINE_BUFSIZE bytes have been copied to the buffer and EOF or new line
** is not found at buffer[size - 1] (transforming size to position to point to
** the last copied byte in the buffer), there is more left to be copied, so we
** reallocate the buffer, increasing its size by a further READLINE_BUFSIZE
** bytes, and then read again, adding the number of bytes read to the prior
** number of bytes read. Once EOF or new line is found, it is replaced with a
** null terminator and the function returns the address of the buffer for
** parsing.
